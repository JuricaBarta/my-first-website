  <h1>This is my first hobby</h1>
  <h1>- Playing  Guitar</h1>
  <p>I've been playing guitar since I was 12 years old, and I really enjoy spendin time playing. <br>
    As I get older and life gives more and more chores I hang out with my guitar less and less, <br>
    which is not so good... I know when I put my chores at ease, I'll  hang out with her more :) <br> <br>
    Here is a picture of me just playing. <br>
